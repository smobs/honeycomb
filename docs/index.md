### Front-end web development and design guidelines
Honeycomb is a set of standards, conventions and tools for building websites at Redgate.*

Honeycomb aspires to create a unified style and experience for Redgate websites, and make web development at Redgate faster.

---

## Who is Honeycomb for?
This standard is for experienced designer / developers.

A secondary audience is the less experienced web maintenance team who want to mark up pages using existing components.

## What are these pages?
This is a documentation website, code library and style guide, which lives inside the web project it documents, using the live project styles and scripts.

## Want to see some source code?
Want to head straight to the source code for the HTML, CSS and JavaScript components? All our Honeycomb code is available in our GitHub repository at https://github.com/red-gate/ingeniously-simple-web.
