Keep CSS completely separate from the HTML.

## Best practices:

* Use meaningful class names and IDs. e.g. "loading" as opposed to "bigYellowSpinnyThing".
* Control the margin and padding on all the elements you use.
* Avoid absolute positioning.
* Avoid !important.
* Don't suffer from divitus and classitus.
* Don't use breaks <br /> just to make space in your layout.
* Avoid hacks unless there is no other way to achieve what you want in IE.
