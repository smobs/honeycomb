If you want to use a library you must have read it, understood it, agree with it, and not be able to write a better one on your best day of coding. <strong>- @sentience</strong>

Frameworks are not evil, they save time, fix cross browser compatibility issues and make us think in new ways. But, they do add overhead so before we jump in bed with them, see above.

## CSS
There are several CSS frameworks available, and it's on our list to investigate them, and decide whether it would benefit us to use one in our development.

## Javascript
We should only use one "Core" javascript framework - [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

Additional libraries for specific tasks not handled by the Core framework can be added if they meet the above requirements e.g. Effects & animation, SVG, Charting, Shims (Add support for features that aren't natively supported by some browsers). Do check the jQuery documentation though, it can do lots, and lots, of cool stuff.
