## What browsers and devices do we support?
Our own user logs (via [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)) are almost all that matters in deciding which browsers we officially support.

<i>However, it mustn't be forgotten that some of our most important customers may be restricted to using older browsers by their IT infrastructure. Therefore we have decided to continue supporting older browsers where the overhead to do so is negligible.</i>

## Do websites need to look the same in every browser?
<strong>No.</strong> A page needs to serve its purpose in function and not appear broken.

It's not about browsers, it's about serving Red Gate's customers by delivering content that that is valuable to them.

## We currently support these browsers
The latest stable versions of all modern browsers and IE8+.

### For Web Apps on redgate.com (shopping cart, etc.)

* IE8+ (Windows)
* Firefox (Windows)
* Chrome (Windows)

### As the Web Design team are Mac users, we might as well also test on:

* Firefox (Mac)
* Chrome (Mac)
* Safari (Mac)
* Opera (Mac)


### Although our logs show relatively few mobile users, it's worth looking at:

* Safari
* Android Browser

If you write front-end code you will need to test in all of these browsers to ensure it looks ok and functions as it should.

## Browser testing your work
Install the latest versions of the above browsers on your local machine.

Different versions of IE are best tested using local VMs.

On a Mac: Use VMware Fusion and its snapshots function (see: [http://snook.ca/archives/other/vmware-fusion-snapshots](http://snook.ca/archives/other/vmware-fusion-snapshots))

On a PC: <i>@TODO</i> (We work on Macs. Phew!)
